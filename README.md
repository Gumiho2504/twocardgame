At the start, both you and the dealer are dealt two cards each. Based on the value of your two cards, you can decide whether to draw a third card or stand. The dealer's decision to draw is determined by an AI.

How to Play:

  1 - Place Your Bet: Begin by placing your bet by clicking on the bet panel.
  2 - Deal the Cards: Click the "Deal" button to receive your two cards.
  3- Draw or Stand:
      - Click the "Draw" button if you want to draw a third card.
      - Click the "Stand" button if you prefer not to draw and stay with your current hand.

Rules:

  1-Automatic Calculation: If the value of your initial two cards or the dealer's initial two cards equals 8 or 9, neither player can draw a third card. The game will automatically calculate the result.
  2 - Winning Conditions:
     - If the sum of your cards is higher than the dealer's, you win.
     - If the dealer's sum is higher, the dealer wins.
     - If both sums are equal, it's a draw.
  3 -Card Values: The highest possible sum is 9, and the lowest is 0.
      - Aces (A): Value of 1
      - 10, J, Q, K: Value of 0
      - 2-9: Each card is worth its face value

Enjoy the game, and may the best hand win!
